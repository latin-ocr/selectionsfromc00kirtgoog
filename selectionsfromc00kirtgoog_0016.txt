10 INTRODUCTION.

sometimes shortened to salutem (Sal. or 5.), and some-
times omitted altogether. The forrnality of the greet-
ing varied with the intimacy of the correspondents,
We find the praenomen alone (XIV.), cognomen alone
(XX I.), praenomen and cognomen, praenomen and nomen

(XXXVII I.), and all three (I‘V.). A very formal greet-
ing contained, as in the last example, the full names of
both persons with their titles, if they held office, and the
praenomina of their fatherS, sometimes of their grand-
fathers also. In correspondence with members of his
own household, Cicero used less regular forms (XIII.,
XXVIII.). The greeting was sometimes followed by
stereotyped expressions of interest in the health and wel-
fare of the person addressed (ΙΙΙ., IV., XLV., XLVIII.,
L.). There was greater variety in the forms of affec-
tionate or considerate farewell; cf. Cura ut valeas
(XII.), Cura ut valeas et me, ut amas, ama (XXI.),
Vale (XXXV.).

5. The collections of Cicero’s letters. —Of the letters
of Cicero’s correspondence there have come down to
us nearly nine hundred in all, of which about four hun-
dred are Epistulae ad Atticum, a somewhat larger num-
ber Epistulae aa' Familiares so called, and the remainder
aa' Quintum Fratrem and ad Brutum. The greater col-
lections are divided into sixteen books each, the Epist.
ad Quint. Frat. into three, and the Epist. aa' Brut. into
two. Nearly one hundred of the letters are from other
than Cicero’s hand3 among the writers are Cato, D.
Brutus, M. BrutuS, CassiuS, Pompey, Caesar, Asinius
Pollio, Lepidus, and other famous men of the time.
