In the preparation of this work for the use of sch0015‚
an attempt has been made to combine the advantages of
the older systematic with the newer discursive method. In
order to profit by the successful features of both methodS,
each exercise has been arranged with the following aims:

1. To give the pupils a comprehensive view of the
various ways in which some particular grammatical relation
may be expressed.

2. To illustrate these by an exercise based upon a
limited portion of the text read, with especial care to intro-
duce only such words and idioms as are to be ‚found in the
text. ‘

3. To make each exercise serve also as a review both
of topics previously studied and of constructions that have
incidentally occurred.

4. To give interest by making the exercises a con-
nected synopsis of the author’s work, avoiding in this,
however, what might in any possible way be used as a
translation.

5.· To give such work as will meet the demands of the
best private and public school&

Specimen Entrance Examination Papers set by leading
colleges have been added for further practice and reference.
