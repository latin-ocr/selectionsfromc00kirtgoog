This edition of the Lives of Cornelius Nepos is virtually
a new work rather than a revision. The material of former
editions has been recast and enlarged. The text has been
thoroughly revised, and the notes and vocabulary entirely
rewritten. The grammatical references are placed at
the foot of the text-page. The text §has over fifty illus-
trations and a fine double page map of the Roman Empire,
Greece, and the Chersonesus, The dates of all important
events are given in the text. The notes are accurate and
explain all difficulties, not giving mere translations without
hinting at their sources. The English-Latin exercises
have been rewritten and cover the full text of the twenty-
five LiveS. These exerciseS‚ while easy and forming
connected sense, give thorough drill on special or difficult
constructionS.
