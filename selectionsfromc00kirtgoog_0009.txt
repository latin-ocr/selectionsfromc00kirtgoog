PREFACE.

THE necessity of constant practice in the sight trans-
lation of Latin and in rapid reading without translation Ἴ
is not yet realized by the greater number of teacherS.
If the study of the Latin language is to have more
’ than a disciplinary value, it must 'lead to the⁴ ability to
read Roman literature with understanding and aesthetic
appreciation; and this ability is pos'sible only to the stu-
dent who has been emancipated from· slavery to gram-
mar and lexicon,——and perhaps we should add, the
‘literal translation.’ The exercises in rapid reading
should be begun as soon as the regular forms and some
little elementary syntax have been mastered‚ and should
be from the first so frequent as to influence the method
of preparation of the more formal lessonS. Rapid read-
ing postulates observance of the Latin order, and the
student who is led to follow the Latin order cannot but
come sooner or later to know the language. No form ¹
of recitation is so apparently easy and vain and yet so
potentially difficult and profitable as the reading of large
amounts of Latin aloud and without translation. The ³
measure of success of this method depends almost en-
tirely upon the teacher‚ as does indeed the success of
all methods of teaching3 but much of Roman literature
made its appeal in the first instance to the ear rather
than the eye, and many a difficult passage may be made
clear by a careful pronouncing of it.

Tlie material for the exercises in rapid reading should
be carefully chosen. The subject matter should be so
