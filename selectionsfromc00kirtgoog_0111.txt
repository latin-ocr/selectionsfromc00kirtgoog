By ALBERT HARKNESS, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor Emeritus in
Brown University.

These new text-books are the crowning triumph of a life-work which ·
has made the name of their author familiar to classical scholars and
teachers everywhere. They represent the latest advances in philological
science, and embody the results of the author’s large experience in
teaching and of his own linguistic studieS‚ together with the suggestions
and advice of eminent German specialists in the field of Historical and
Comparative Grammar. The peculiar qualities of simplicity, clearness,
and adaptation of treatment to the practical needs of the student and of
the class room,—qualities that have always characterized the Harkness
Grammars‚—have been preserved and even intensified in these new books.

The Complete Latin Grammar is designed at once as a text-book
for the class room and a book of reference for the student. It aims not
only to present systematically for the benefit of the beginner the lead-
ing facts and laws of the Latin language, but also to provide accurately

for the needs of the advanced student.
The Short Latin Grammar is published for the benefit of those who

prefer to begin with a more elementary manual, or those who do not
contemplate a collegiate course. In the preparation of this work the
convenience and interest of the student have been carefully consulted.'
The paradigms‚ mles, and discussions have in general been introduced
in the exact form and language of the Complete Latin Grammar by
which it may at any time be supplemented. The numbering of the
sections in the two books is also alike.
