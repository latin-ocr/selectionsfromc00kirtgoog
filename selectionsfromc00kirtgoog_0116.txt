This book is designed to rneet the needs of students
pursuing Latin Courses (1) in which but a single term is
given to the study of Ovid; (2) in which this author is
not taken up until after Vergil or Cicer03 (3) or in which
Ovid has not hitherto been included among the school
texts read. It is believed that the book will be found ‚a
natural and easy link between the prose of the second or
third year and the beginning of Vergil.

The first three stories are accompanied by a parallel
version in the order of ordinary Latin prose with the
quantities marked.

The divisions into feet and the caesuras are indicated
in the first hundred lines by an unobtrusive but effective
device, in order to facilitate the acquisition of the art of
scansion, which is sometimes difficult.

The text is accompanied by synnnyms, both of words
not usual in prose and of common words in extraordinary
uses, The notes are full, and are designed to meet the
actual needs of the student.

The book contains a complete vocabulary with refer-
ences to the text by lineS.
