Harper and Miller’s Vergil furnishes not only the latest and best
edition of the Aeneid and Bucolics, but is a most important addition to
the study of Vergil's life, character, and writings. It is based on the
same plan and possesses in a general way the same distinctive features
which have given Harper and Tolman’s Caesar such wide popularity and
use. Among its special features are:

A GENERAL INTRODUCTION, including a collection of material for
the literary studyof Vergil not contained in any other similar text-book.

THE NOTES, which are unusually full and helpful. They include
such aids sor the study of Vergil as have never before been collated sor
the use of the general student.

THE Mun—This has been carefully constructed to present all the
places mentioned in the Aeneid and show the course of Aeneas from
Troy to his final landing in Italy.

THE ILLUSTRATIONs.—Besides numerous smaller engravings, an
entirely new feature in school text-books is furnished by the twelve
full-page illustrations reproduced from carefully selected photographs of
famous paintings and statues.

THE VOCABULARY.-Special pains have been expended on the
vocabulary. Following the vocabulary is a list of all words which
occur ten times or more in the books included in this edition of the

Aeneid.

Copies sent, prepaid‚ to any address on recapt of the price.
