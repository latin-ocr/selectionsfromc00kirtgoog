This First Greek Book from its logical sequence of
subjectS, its clearness and conciseness of statement, and
its freedom from unnecessary details, will appeal to both
teacher and pupil. Believing that the true aim of Greek
study is the development of the power to read Greek, the
pupil is introduced at an early stage to practice in the
translation of a continuous text, including dialogueS,
fables, and reading exerciseS.

The English-Greek exercises have been made sub-
ordinate to the sentences to be translated into English,

. as that will be the pupil's main work in the study of Greek.

An effort has been made throughout to give continuity to
the exercises for translation, and at the same time to fix
meanings and constructions by frequent repetition and
occasional review lessonS.

The book is fully illustrated and contains in addition
to the reading exercises given in the body of the book
selections from the Anabasis, Hellenica, Cyropaedia‚ and
Memorabilia, an Appendix containing in compendious form
for reference the rules of euphony and syntax and the
paradigms of declension and conjugation given in the
regular lessonS. Altogether, the book is complete, concise,
interesting, and practical, and one which teachers can use
successfully with any class of beginnerS.
